"10","rn387519680","Candelaria B","","47 reviews","The Cathedral of Cordoba…where faith and travelers whispered",5,"29/06/2016","In order to understand places in which Faith thrives, history counts. This is a magnificent work of art that many people from all over the world come to visit. Some call it a Mosque and others call it a Cathedral, The Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba. You would hear the locals say Mezquita for mosque so tried. It is fun to practice Spanish! What matters is that this is one of the ancient of edifices still standing from the time in the early 8th century when Muslims governed the Muslim Iberia. Muslim Iberia included most of Spain, Portugal, and parts of Southern France. I like history and that is why I travel. There are complex sides of the story. Researchers stated that before the Mosque, there was a temple to the Roman god, Janus. The Visigoths who seized Córdoba in 572 converted the temple into a church. The name of the Church at that time was The Catholic Basilica of Saint Vincent of Lérins. The church was converted into a mosque and then completely rebuilt by the descendants of the exiled Umayyad’s. They were the first Islamic dynasty that had originally ruled from their capital Damascus from 661 until 750. Another group, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyad’s. Prince Abd-al Rahman moved from Damascus to Spain and added the orange trees that now you see in the courtyard of the grandeur dwelling. The church returned to Christian rule in 1236. I would like to share something I learned from my travel guide. When the Muslims conquered Spain in 711 the church was divided into two sides, one Christian and one Muslim. The Great Mosque of Cordoba is a chief sample of the Muslim brilliantly architectural styles. Indeed, when you walk throughout the site there is an extraordinary combination of basic components connected to Islamic architecture. For example, there are the dome, the arch, and the vault. Take your time and make sure to observe the giant arches and the columns made from jasper, onyx, marble, and granite. Admire the beautiful shrines built with Byzantine mosaics. There is also a feature that stands apart from the rest of the architecture, the 16th-century Baroque choir. Look up and you will see an intricate ceiling and richly carved 18th-century choir stalls. Do not rush! Take it all in and think about the souls that have seen this richly ornate church and mosque. Then walk outside and sit by the orange trees. Close your eyes and mediate on the beauty of this place. Finally if able you can climb up the Torre Campanario. There are restrictions and this requires physical strength to climb up. On top you can see a panoramic view of Córdoba and its ambiances. There is a fee to this site, 8 euros’ adults and 4 euros’ for children. Practice safety, as this venue is crowded and do not engage some ladies offering a Rosemary leaf. These beautiful ladies wish to tell your future and it can cost you lots of euros’! It would take two hours from Madrid to Cordova by train. The Cathedral is accessible by all mode of transportation. It is open all week but times change on Sundays and holidays.

It is big - so massive that a Gothic cathedral was built inside the mosque - and lots of chapels!The interior of the mosque is spectacular – a forest of pillars and arches. 856 of the granite, jasper and marble columns remain – some were removed to make way for the Christian parts of the building. Horseshoe-shaped arches consisting of alternating red brick and white stone were placed above the lower pillars, which has given the Mezquita its distinctive character. Of course, there is much more to this magnificent building than pillars and arches!

It is big - so massive that a Gothic cathedral was built inside the mosque - and lots of chapels!The interior of the mosque is spectacular – a forest of pillars and arches. 856 of the granite, jasper and marble columns remain – some were removed to make way for the Christian parts of the building. Horseshoe-shaped arches consisting of alternating red brick and white stone were placed above the lower pillars, which has given the Mezquita its distinctive character. Of course, there is much more to this magnificent building than pillars and arches!

This is, I must say , one of the most splendid buildings/churches that I have ever been in, certainly the most unusual. The history and story proceeding it, touching and amazing. The mosque dates from the eighth century, was consecrated a Catholic cathedral after the Reconquista in 1236, and had a section of it altered into a cathedral nave in the 16th century. You have to read up on the history surrounding all this!The structure is supported by marble columns that were salvaged from the Roman temple that had previously occupied the site, as well from other Roman ruins. The double arches that these columns support are composed of marble blocks and bricks. This is such a work of artistry and will touch the heart of, and challenge, the bricklayer. The vast space is broken up by the nave built into its centre. This could seem a bit intrusive, but really is done so beautifully, it just makes the structure all the more amazing. On the one side , we see the Mihrad, a beautifully gilded prayer nook.Here we have elements of two of the World's great religions, together under the same roof. Of course, this can offer up some interesting discussion. Outside, there is the courtyard, with its citrus groves, very Spain like, orange trees, abundantly, everywhere.

"564","rn350363857","Lizzieteaches","Lutterworth, England, United Kingdom","31 reviews","OMG!",5,"23/02/2016","This stunning conglomerate religious centre is incredible. Built (probably) on the ruins of a synagogue, the Christians raised a church. When the Moors arrived they split the site in two and built a mosque to rival all mosques. Gradually they 'purchased' more of the site and expanded it to a huge size. Eventually recaptured by the Christians, the new owners recognised the intrinsic beauty of the mosque and just ' adapted it' to be a cathedral. Beautiful Arabic script adorns tiles over Arabic arches, and sudden alcoves are cut into this, retiled with bright colours and huge statues of saints stand proud in the new space. The organ and choir stalls are incredible. The architectural integrity of the building has been preserved by more modern developers and the archeology of the building is very evident and well presented. Buy a guide book before you go in.

Built (probably) on the ruins of a synagogue, the Christians raised a church. When the Moors arrived they split the site in two and built a mosque to rival all mosques. Gradually they 'purchased' more of the site and expanded it to a huge size. Eventually recaptured by the Christians, the new owners recognised the intrinsic beauty of the mosque and just ' adapted it' to be a cathedral. Beautiful Arabic script adorns tiles over Arabic arches, and sudden alcoves are cut into this, retiled with bright colours and huge statues of saints stand proud in the new space. The organ and choir stalls are incredible. The architectural integrity of the building has been preserved by more modern developers and the archeology of the building is very evident and well presented. Buy a guide book before you go in.

Children under 14yrs go for 4 Euros and adults for 8 Euros. We got in at 10am before it got too hot. It was relatively cool in the building and is relatively wheelchair accessible.A grove of citrus trees and small fountains within a walled garden provide a peaceful setting to the entrance of this former mosque &amp; now a cathedral some of which dates back to the 7th Century which was then a church and then 8th to the early 13th Century when it was a mosque and since then back to a cathedral. In its heyday the Mezquita was the third most significant Moslem place of worship. Now it is no longer a place of worship for Moslems only Christians although the Moslem community are campaigning for the building to be shared. One would hope that Pope Francis grants them their wish so both faiths could use the building for religious worship as a symbol of unity and mutual respect. The Al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem are now the top 3 sites. Nevertheless this is an excellent example of Moorish architecture and a good place to see the fundamental differences between mosques and churches. The beautiful simplicity of design of the mosque with the intricate geometric shapes and patterns, 850 pillars made of Granite, Jasper and Marble support the red and white brick and stone Arabic arches like a forest of palm trees. The mosque contrasts strikingly with the Christians display of ornate golden baroque religious iconography with Christ on the cross, relics and statues with their emphasis on death and the hope of an afterlife. Of course the mosque does not allow for the artistic representation of the prophets, human or animal forms and is less austere and visually pleasing. It is nice to see that the Christians did not destroy all of the mosque but incorporated Christian elements with it.One wonders how the conversion of the mosque to the Cathedral has affected the design and feel of the original building. There are early Roman artefacts on display in the site as well as details of the Islamic ceramic tiles with their incredible geometric patterns and lots of tombs for the Spanish noblemen.Visiting this building one does get a sense of the greatness of this City at the time of the Moors with its libraries, hospitals and universities, in fact possibly the largest city in the world at the time. I always remind my children that we owe a lot to Islam for preserving the teachings of the Greek scientists, philosophers and mathematicians during the Dark Ages and building upon that work. This building steeped in all this history is more than a UNESCO World Heritage Site it has the potential to build a bridge between the two faiths in the 21st Century and to be a symbol for future tolerance and understanding.Beyond all this this is a building worth visiting for an architectural, historical and cultural perspective.

This site was so impressive and for €8 each, made it one of the best value tours so far. We purchased one audio guide to share between us, which worked out really well. As one of us listened to the information, the other one was able to look more closely at the features. The audio guide was a must!I found it hard to select the correct name for this place; it is now the Cathedral of Córdoba, but its long history prior to the 13th Century with the Islamic faith makes it hard to ignore that influence. I prefer the often used term of ""Mosque-Cathedral"".This building is recognised as one of the great creations of Islamic architecture. It has rows upon rows of red and white striped columns that seem to go on forever and wonderful mosaics in shimmering gold and bold blues. We had read earlier that the geometric patterns used by the Muslims in their mosaics were meant to not represent any shape found in nature. Originally founded as a Mezquita in 785, after about 14 years of being shared between Christains and Muslims, when the Christians sold their half to the Muslims. Over the next 200 years, different Muslim leaders added to the Mosque in order to house the growing number of Muslims. There are over 800 columns still standing and it is considered the largest temple in the World. I think we heard it can hold 40,000 people!The minaret was built to call the Muslims to prayer, but is now used as a belltower to call Catholics to Mass. We decided not to climb to the top as it was still very hot today.In 1236, King Ferdinand III conquered Córdoba and returned the building to the Catholics. It underwent a purification ritual to ensure each stone edifice was turned into a scared site consecrated to Christ. And so began the work to transform the 'church' into a Catholic place of worship. The church is overwhelmingly Islamic, but the literature and tour were so obviously Catholic. The tourist brochures refer to ""The Islamic Intervention"", yet it was a mosque for more than five centuries.What we noticed today was a Catholic Cathedral built in the middle of a mosque, and we read that 19 of the mosque doors are now closed. These doors would have at one time filled the mosque with light. In the 16th Century the centre of the building was torn out to allow construction of the cathedral - with rich marble and jasper features and the Coro(choir) with fine 18th Century carved mahogany stalls.I have come away from today's tour with a very sore neck indeed as this was a necessary manoeuvre in order to see the beauty and contrast in the Islamic and Christian designs. My recommendation for a visitor would be to bring a small compact mirror so you can view the ceilings without the neck-bending. I had first noted this trick when we visited the Sistine Chapel a few years ago.When we arrived for our tour we could hear beautiful organ music playing. It lasted for about half an hour and added a magical touch to our visit. There were two organs, one on either side of the Coro. A series of chapels has been constructed along the sides of the original mosque. These offer a huge contrast in design between Islamic and Catholic symbols; the latter being more opulent and colourful. In contrast to the Islamic art, there are lots of statues and loads of paintings and murals. This chapel is dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, and was installed in 1854 when the Pope made Mary's Immaculate Conception dogma of the Church. The various chapels were built by believers whose desire it was to be buried here.Inside there are a number of museums and treasuries, these too are worth a look.</p>",223,"Fabulous, but pack a compact mirror to save your neck!.

It is of course intriguing for those individuals who have an understanding of the history of the region, but it also will interest anyone who appreciates architecture. It's graceful double-arches and intricate domes and ceiling detailing are incredible works of art that are among the best, if not thee best, examples of Islamic architecture in Spain. While the newer Christian cathedral was also interesting, as other posters have noted, it does seem out of place next to the older mosque. But despite this, the frequent placement of Islamic architecture next to Christian architecture is what makes Spain so unique. I visited the mosque in June in the morning, and it was not very busy. Purchasing a ticket was easy. The booth is located next to the tower in the courtyard. Although the individual working there did not speak English (I was surprised at the lack of English-speaking staff at attractions in Spain), he was able to provide us with the ticket and, most importantly, the map. As a note to visitors, once you enter the mosque, you may want to ask a staff member or security guard to help you orient yourself as it isn't obvious on the map which entry you are using. Once a security guard pointed out where I was within the mosque, the map became extremely helpful. The tower apparently has a great view of the city, but it was closed on the day that I was there.

But once you step through the gates it is hard to find words to express the first impression. We decided to go early in the morning (well, 10.30 am) and opt for the audio guide rather than joining the massive guided tours. This way you can explore the building by yourself and at your own pace. This comes especially handy when several of the guided tour groups clash at one or the other point of interest which can be quite annoying. The audio guide explains the history in short but yet very easy to follow passages and allows you in between to enjoy the buildings overlooked architectural hidden gems. The bad: Unfortunately sights like this come with tourists and with them the sometimes inappropriate behavior. While most religious sides have strict dress codes here we’ve seen people in extreme tight shorts, flip flops and tank tops. Although I understand that Cordoba can get very hot during summer I’m not convinced that means disrespecting places like this. Also be prepared to “fight” your way through crowds at some of the highlights of the building as you most likely might only see people taking endless pictures with their smartphones rather than taking a moment to absorb what they are actually looking at. Unfortunately modern technology means that you might also encounter people on their phone with video chat and screaming at their phones which yet again shouldn’t be the point if you want to enjoy this marvel of religion and architecture. The conclusion: When in Cordoba this is definitely the number one Must See sight. Go early to avoid the busloads of guided tours and if you are more interested in exploring the place by yourself get the audio guide. Be prepared to deal patently with people hanging forever around the highlights of the building before you might catch a glimpse.

It was so frustrating.Plus, you go inside, and then you see the paradoxes.If you look up, then you see the amazing arches from the Muslim era.But anything else is a paradox.This is an ex-mosque turned into a church.They tried mixing the Muslim design with the Christian one but failed miserably.Whenever these two design intersect in this place, they simply don't fit.For example, you see a beautiful arch, then they put inside a cross with Jesus's figure. These simply don't match.Same for the altar.

It was so frustrating.Plus, you go inside, and then you see the paradoxes.If you look up, then you see the amazing arches from the Muslim era.But anything else is a paradox.This is an ex-mosque turned into a church.They tried mixing the Muslim design with the Christian one but failed miserably.Whenever these two design intersect in this place, they simply don't fit.For example, you see a beautiful arch, then they put inside a cross with Jesus's figure.

We took the train from Sevilla to Cordoba and walked from the station to these wonderful sights on the day before Easter and were thrilled to be a part of the throngs of tourists and pilgrims representing both religions and cultures!",121,5,0.625,0.75,0.875,0.3125,"positive","positive","positive","negative"

There is evidence the original Iberian people occupied the land around the Guadalquivir river. Then came the Romans, followed by the Visigoths, then the Iberians once more, invaded by and conquered by the Arabs.  The Arabs for centuries ruled the lands around Cordoba and used the city as the center of their Califate. From there the Arab control extended to the west as far as the Atlantic ocean, north to present day Burgos and east as far as Barcelona.  Then from the north came the new-comers. They were called the Spanish, The Spanish Kings emerged from the dark ages strong and well armoured, but the Arabs were numerous and fine horsemen. The war for the re-conquest of Spain took centuries. But finally under the Catholic King and Queen, Isabel and Fernando the Arab Muslims were pushed from the continent. The remnants of the Romans, the Arabs and the former glory of the Spanish Empire all co-exist inside the old city walls of Cordoba. The Cathedral is actually build inside the old Mosque of the Arab Muslim religion. The contrast is breathtaking in its scope and effect. The tiny narrow streets of antiquity teem with citizens and tourists everyday of the year. The finest time to visit Cordoba is during the opening of the private patios in the springtime. It is absolutely important to plan far in advance as the hotels and the entire city is filled with the curious travellers. However, the city is a treasure at anytime of the year. In this review I have only toured the area immediately around the great Cathedral. Entering the city across the old Roman Bridge, though the Great Roman Gate. Passing the Statue declaring domination by the Spanish. Following the street to the left of the Cathedral, passing the Congress building on your right. Then on your left the side entrance to the Patio of Oranges. The tickets to the great Cathedral are across the patio near the formal entrance. Once your tour has finished, leave by the grand formal entrance in the center of the patio directly across from the formal Cathedral entrance.

We were at first concerned when we saw that headsets were being used and that we were to start with an orientation video, but a tour guide was there to lead the tour and take us through in a group, lighting each section of the mosque in turn. I had been to this ""wonder of the world"" before in the daytime and I can say I saw more this time at night thanks to the lighting.

The commentary was a bit overblown but we still learned a lot as we went through phases of the mosque and cathedral in the order of its construction. We ended up agreeing that the night tour was very special and worth the money. It is a bit difficult to book this tour. We tried to do it from El Corte Ingles website without luck from home, and then from the travel agency of El Corte Ingles at a branch of the store in another part of Spain but were told we couldn't as we weren't in Andalucia.

I'd done a little research online as I was worried about parking. We parked in the Avenida del Aeropuerto for free, although having now been there, there is a large underground car park almost right next door to this place - at the corner of Avenida Dr Fleming and Calle Kairuan/Cairuan. On a hot 34º day, we found the entrance (there are three I think, one on each side of the courtyard garden) and proceeded to buy the tickets from the booth there. On entering the main building you are immediately struck by the sheer volume of the interior (and cool on a hot day!). I was keen to take lots of photo's and was amazed that even in August there were times when I could take some 'people-free' shots. In other words it is not over subscribed with tourists, at least if you go early as we did - we were inside by around 10.30am. Kids will probably find it boring. In short, if you like places like the Alhambra Palace etc, you will love this. We took around two hours to walk around. Loved it. My top tip is to try taking photo's with the camera on Night Scene mode. It will necessitate putting the camera on timer and resting it on the floor, as the exposure will be too long for sharp photo's. I tried it and was pleased with the results. Flash photo's were poor. That said, ipad results were good in the more naturally lit areas.",322,"Worth the drive. I wasn't sure what to expect on our trip to Cordoba - August, hot, no advanced tickets. But what a joy.

On checking the proximity to Granada, we decided to visit Cordoba, approx 100 miles north of Granada. It was nothing less than a most remarkable experience! The town is regarded by the locals as the ""little sister to Granada. "" You stay in history......the entire area is comprised of ancient buildings , some of which have been converted to hotels.

What it is, is mainly a cavernous hall of light and shadow. The great prayer hall is filled with a forest of hundreds of evenly-spaced columns of different heights and dramatically-lit double arches. The hall is kept half-dark, so our eyes focused on the double arches--red-yellow horseshoe and semi-circular arches--that resemble the light coming through trees. Indeed, we understand that the rows of columns originally were meant to mirror the rows of trees outside when there were no walls enclosing the prayer hall. The hall is so massive that the huge flow of tourists is lost inside the dark spaces, giving us a feeling of at-oneness with the space.What it represents is the unity of the Muslim and Christian worship architecture, with Christian chapels raising the eye heavenward, between the horizontal “forest” of the Muslim prayer hall. The contrast is most extreme at the domed Capilla Mayor and chancel. The juxtaposition of the cathedral architecture and the prayer hall evokes the golden era of religious tolerance under the Muslim Caliphate, but we are aware that the spaces are used now only for Christian worship. So we felt it was both a monument to religious tolerance and an architectural wonder, well worth the modest price of admission, and well worth the experience, even with a large tour group..

First, I accidentally paid for the wrong tour because I went to a website for the ""Mezquita"" which is the non-official website that offers related tours at nearby ruins including a dilapidated mosque but not THE Mosque of cordoba. If you want to see the famous mosque you have to go to the website for the catedral de cordoba.

The main problem? The out of place so called ""cathedral"" and the overdone catholic statues, paintings, and ornamentation filling every nook and cranny, marring every possible view you could try to capture in a photo, and the bars across every side hallway or room making it seem like a prison for garish displays and hunks of stone from catholic carvings. I could only envision the Catholics or more likely businessmen who arrange for tourism in the ""cathedral"" suffering from a religious Napoleon syndrome, feeling they must stuff the gorgeous mosque with as many catholic displays as possible, trying to overpower the majesty of the old mosque and make Cordoba the home of a famous cathedral rather than the home of a famous mosque. The result is a dismal failure of a tourist attraction, an absolutely dark and disappointing interior, and a presumptuous catholic cacophony of garish displays. I will never waste my time or money returning to cordoba. I'll simply go back to the Alhambra in Granada when I want to see Arab architecture in Spain (the best kept buildings...

The out of place so called ""cathedral"" and the overdone catholic statues, paintings, and ornamentation filling every nook and cranny, marring every possible view you could try to capture in a photo, and the bars across every side hallway or room making it seem like a prison for garish displays and hunks of stone from catholic carvings. I could only envision the Catholics or more likely businessmen who arrange for tourism in the ""cathedral"" suffering from a religious Napoleon syndrome, feeling they must stuff the gorgeous mosque with as many catholic displays as possible, trying to overpower the majesty of the old mosque and make Cordoba the home of a famous cathedral rather than the home of a famous mosque. The result is a dismal failure of a tourist attraction, an absolutely dark and disappointing interior, and a presumptuous catholic cacophony of garish displays. I will never waste my time or money returning to cordoba. I'll simply go back to the Alhambra in Granada when I want to see Arab architecture in Spain (the best kept buildings... The alcazar in seville has nothing on Alhambra) and when I want to see a beautiful cathedral I will go to seville or Barcelona.

There had first been a temple to the Roman god, Janus, on this site in ancient times. The temple was converted into a Christian church by invading Visigoths who seized Cordoba in 572. Next, the church was converted into a mosque and then completely rebuilt by the descendants of the exiled Umayyads—the first Islamic dynasty from 661 until 750. Each one making more fabulous improvements. You can feel yourself walking back through the centuries, through the millennia, with every turn and even glancing down below where the excavated remains of the Visigothic Church of St. Vincent, from the 7th century, are still visible via plexiglass floor sections inside the Mezquita. The town was an Iberian and Roman city in ancient times which became an Islamic Kingdom by force. During the Middle Ages, Cordoba developed into the intellectual centre of Europe and, despite being predominantly Muslim then, was tolerant toward its Christian and Jewish minorities. The Great Mosque of Cordoba-now a Cathedral, alongside the persevering 2000 year old Roman bridge, are the best known highlights of the city. The building is most notable for its arcaded hypostyle hall, with 856 ancient Roman columns of jasper, onyx, marble, and granite. These were made from pieces of the ancient Roman temple which had occupied the site previously, as well as other destroyed ancient Roman buildings. I am not sure I can express in words the effect of seeing a fabulous Mosque attached to an equally fabulous Cathedral. It is perhaps the most remarkable building I have ever had the pleasure to visit. The two truly exist beautifully together. The Historic Centre of Cordoba now comprises the labyrinth of very narrow streets surrounding this structural monument, Moorish style gardens, together with all the blocks of houses and shoppes around the mosque-cathedral.

The great, ancient cultures, as the Iberian and the Roman, were the witnesses and active participants to or in its tremendous development in the old times, i.e. before Christ. In the postclassical period ( Middle Ages), Cordoba became the capital of an Islamic caliphate. You can see everywhere, when You find Yourself within the formerly walls of the city, the remnants or reminders of architectural acting, either from Iberian civilization or Roman culture, during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.But the most significant reminder is that of Islamic rule, i.e. Caliphate of Cordoba and it was the central place for all Iberian Peninsula.As in Granada, here we also had during the past centuries, the tolerance of Muslim society toward the Christian and Jewish minorities.Naturally, by all means, the most impressive complex of buildings and pertainings paths and alleys of orange trees, is the gorgeous Mezquita de Cordoba or Cathedral of Cordoba. It is located between the Calle Torrijos and Calle de La Grada Rodonda, in the proximity of the big river of Spain, the Rio Guadalquivir.When You enter inside,You instantly get astonished by its huge hall with plenty of arcades and columns, that support the dome.

We had booked Malaga- Cordoba high speed rail, it took less than an hour to reach Cordoba.Cordoba's modern train station is located in Avenida de America. To get to the old town, taxi (about 6€) is available or just walk about 25 minutes. We had wonderful weather, it was slightly cold (average day temperature was 15 degree C) and thus walked. But I feel that it will be very hot in summer and taxi is advisable.As an alternative to the AVE there are also cheaper RENFE trains, from Malaga (for around 15-20€) We took a guided trip and entered at 11-30am.This is a mosque cum Catholic Church. Initially there was a basilica here (San Vicente Basilica), Moors came here in 785 AD, destroyed it and built a Mosque.After that in next 500 years it was expanded. In 1236, King Ferdinand III re conquered Cordoba and slowly it was transformed into a church. Today it has a massive size of 25000 sq. m and originally it had more than 1000 columns, today it has 880 columns.The architecture, design of columns, Chapels, The Cathedral treasury etc. are remarkable things to see.

The atmosphere is heightened by the lighting and the music, which moves from Arabic to Baroque in keeping with the historical changes. Numbers on the tour are kept to 100, which might sound a lot, but we never felt rushed and it is such an immense building that it feels, as the Mezquita website describes, a small group. Highly recommended.",137,8,0.785714285714286,1,0.928571428571429,0.5,"positive","positive","positive","neutral"

I really liked the old modest Islamic architectures but was saddened at the 'bling-bling' of the christian architecture. Also the center part of the mosque was boarded up, but we could see a bit through the top part, the fact that the Christians had put a king with a cross and the earth in his hand right below the Arabic scripture of the Qur'an, was like a thorn in the eye. I was very offended. It was also freezing inside the mosque but almost 24 degrees outside in the garden.  I had actually thought that it was quite small from the outside but once I was inside it, i thought t was endless.We found a parking lot which charged us 7 euros for about 4 or 5 hrs. When your in front of many signs directing that the Mezquita is on the right and the church is on the left, take the left and keep going once you see a monument like building its actually a parking space and the people who work there are very nice.Furthermore if you take the right turn you will find the mosque and many horse carriages and very small roads with a lot of minus signs. We took a time to explore the shops but bought nothing but subway, it's very expensive there. If you've rented or live in a hotel in Fuengirola or nearby you can buy cheap Spanish fans and other souvenirs for 1.75 E in the 'shopping centre' opposite the train station.

Standing in the historic centre, it is one of the most beautiful examples of Muslim art in Spain. It was built in 785 by the Muslim emir Abdurrahman I, on the site of an ancient Visigoth church of San Vicente.

There’s no good reason why anyone should have to wear shoes in a cathedral and insisting about it is nothing but a sign of a repressive society that I can and will not stand for. And don’t talk to me about modesty or anything like that: in contrast to other people in the cathedral I was perfectly “church-going dressed”. My barefootness was discovered late during my visit and I’ve got to say it was quite symbolic that I had to wear shoes in a catholic church that itself trampled on an Islamic mosque, which you usually enter without shoes. Entrance is 8 €/person, no discount for retirees, and there are audio guides (separate from the ticket counter) for 3,50 €/guide. For the audio guide, you have to leave an ID card as deposit (or 20 €, I think).

The tall imposing walls that surround it are the first sign of the great scale of what is inside. Once inside the repitition of arches over a large area is the immediate attraction and is very photogenic. I have four good reasons why you should go early 1) you can avoid the tour groups, although there will probably be quite a few other visitors, 2) you can enter for free before 10am, the usual entry fee is 8euros, 3) you will probably have to plan to stay in Cordoba which has lots more to offer, but mostly 4) there is a service in the cathedral between 9 and 10ish which creates a beautiful serene sound to accompany your visit around the mosque part of the building and creates a lovely atmosphere. While the service is underway, the cathedral, which is in the centre of the building is roped off, and you will not be able to take pictures of it, but when the service is complete the ropes are removed and you can enter the cathedral part which is ornate and bright in contrast to the surrounding area. There is also a museum with some lovely artefacts at the back of the Mezquita which only opens after the service is over.

The tall imposing walls that surround it are the first sign of the great scale of what is inside. Once inside the repitition of arches over a large area is the immediate attraction and is very photogenic. I have four good reasons why you should go early 1) you can avoid the tour groups, although there will probably be quite a few other visitors, 2) you can enter for free before 10am, the usual entry fee is 8euros, 3) you will probably have to plan to stay in Cordoba which has lots more to offer, but mostly 4) there is a service in the cathedral between 9 and 10ish which creates a beautiful serene sound to accompany your visit around the mosque part of the building and creates a lovely atmosphere. While the service is underway, the cathedral, which is in the centre of the building is roped off, and you will not be able to take pictures of it, but when the service is complete the ropes are removed and you can enter the cathedral part which is ornate and bright in contrast to the surrounding area. There is also a museum with some lovely artefacts at the back of the Mezquita which only opens after the service is over.

This leads you directly to the Mezquita/Cathedral.Even if you aren't driving, this is a lovely riverside walk. On a Saturday morning we saw lots of locals strolling, jogging, etc. And the views on the bridge towards the city/Cathedral are great.Daily morning masses are still held here, so admission is free before 10 am. We did not get an audio guide (we'd had back luck with those in Seville). However, this was our last stop on a 2.5 week visit to Spain, so we already knew a little about Spanish history. I'd recommend some sort of guide to help explain things if you don't.I did find it fascinating that this seemed to be the one place in Spain where the Catholic church decided to build around the mosque, rather than tear it down. The juxtaposition between the two styles of architecture is amazing.There are an awful lot of columns in here; if you have kids, you can keep them entertained for quite a while by sending them on a hunt to find all the different stonemason marks around the church (there's a little exhibit about this on one wall to get them started). There's also some toilet facilities hiding in the corner of the church.Even if you have 'church fatigue', do not miss this. The shafts of light pouring down on those red and white arches is a sight you will remember for a long time.If you need more info, the tourist office is on the Calle Torrijos, just on the West side of the Cathedral. They also can tell you where to see some of Cordoba's famous patios.And finally, you might think this would be a tourist trap, given it's location, but I strongly recommend Bodegas Mezquita, right behind the Cathedral, for a wonderful meal.

I'd recommend some sort of guide to help explain things if you don't.I did find it fascinating that this seemed to be the one place in Spain where the Catholic church decided to build around the mosque, rather than tear it down. The juxtaposition between the two styles of architecture is amazing.There are an awful lot of columns in here; if you have kids, you can keep them entertained for quite a while by sending them on a hunt to find all the different stonemason marks around the church (there's a little exhibit about this on one wall to get them started). There's also some toilet facilities hiding in the corner of the church.Even if you have 'church fatigue', do not miss this. The shafts of light pouring down on those red and white arches is a sight you will remember for a long time.If you need more info, the tourist office is on the Calle Torrijos, just on the West side of the Cathedral. They also can tell you where to see some of Cordoba's famous patios.And finally, you might think this would be a tourist trap, given it's location, but I strongly recommend Bodegas Mezquita, right behind the Cathedral, for a wonderful meal. They have an excellent 14 euros Menu of the Day, featuring regional specialties.",396,18,0.625,0.708333333333333,0.708333333333333,0.475,"positive","positive","positive","neutral"

As a Muslim I loved what I saw. Read up the history and how its design has changed. That cant be told in a review. The Mosque was expanded several times and right in the middle a hole was ripped where a cathedral was inserted. I consider this blasphemy and unforgivable but then that's happens when one religion is replaced by another. The horse shoe arch design is world famous. The free brochure you can pick up is worth reading. The literature would have you believe the Christians came and saved this from neglect and destruction and through its use as a cathedral has been saved. This is convincing considering how much money Spain has and how much it makes from tourists. However there is part of the mosque which is closed off - but you can peak inside - how much beauty was lost during the last few centuries. You get a glimpse of the Alhambra style detail - work with plaster and the work is unmatched. True glimpse into the master craftsmen who built this. Follow this by the minbar - where the call to prayer was led - and you see how unique this building is. Unfortunately the arches now take the attention alone.At one point I got on my feet/bum to take a photo and a security guard was quick enough to warn me to not do that again. The fear that I might break into a prayer is unnecessary. The recurring glances from other security just re enforced the negative belief that Spain is an intolerant country for Islam.
